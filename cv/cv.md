## ***Briefly About Myself:***


I am an economist by education.  Worked as an accountant for 5 years. I am currently working as a real estate agent.


I want to completely change my life and start doing what I'm interested in. This is web development.
I am interested in the process of creating web applications and websites. It's interesting to understand how everything works from the inside and interacts with each other.
I like that by studying new technologies in the field of IT, you can get unlimited opportunities for professional growth.


My perseverance and attention to detail acquired while working as an accountant, as well as the ability to learn and acquire new skills, help me in mastering a new profession.
